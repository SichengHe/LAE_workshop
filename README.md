### When/where/who
This workshop was delivered on Oct 14, 2022 to LAE students (mainly first-year Ph.D. and master students) at MIT.

### Content
In this workshop, we will talk about the features of nice (publication-quality) figures and how to generate nice figures for your research.
You will learn how to do it using `python`, specifically, the package `matplotlib`.
Please bring one figure with its `python` source file with you for the workshop.

The workshop is divided into three parts.
In part one, we will conduct a case study to show why we shall never use the default settings of `matplotlib` to generate figures. 
We will also demonstrate how to improve the default figure to publication-quality figure.
In part two, we will work together using the tools you learned in part one to improve the figure you bring.
Finally, in part three, we will conclude with some ideas of how to be efficient in visualization in graduate school.
